    \section{Basis of an abelian group}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $G$ be an abelian group, and let $S = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a finite subset of $G$. We say that $S$ \emph{generates} $G$ if for all $x \in G$, there exist $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{Z}$, for $1 \leq i \leq n$ such that
        \[x = \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \dots + \alpha_n x_n.\]
        If so, we denote $G = \langle x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        Let $G$ be an abelian group, and let $S = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a finite subset of $G$. We say that $S$ is a \emph{basis} for $G$ if:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $S$ generates $G$, and
            \item for all $m_i \in \mathbb{Z}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,
            \[m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2 + \dots + m_n x_n = 0 \implies m_i x_i = 0 \ \forall \ 1 \leq i \leq n.\]
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $G$ be an abelian group, and let $S = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a basis for $G$. Then,
        \[G \cong \langle x_1 \rangle \times \langle x_2 \rangle \times \dots \times \langle x_n \rangle.\]
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        Define the map $\varphi \colon \langle x_1 \rangle \times \langle x_2 \rangle \times \dots \times \langle x_n \rangle \to G$ by
        \[\varphi(\alpha_1 x_1, \alpha_2 x_2, \dots, \alpha_n x_n) = \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \dots + \alpha_n x_n.\]
        Since $G$ is abelian, the map is a homomorphism. Moreover, since $S$ generates $G$, the map is surjective. Now, let $(\alpha_1 x_1, \alpha_2 x_2, \dots, \alpha_n x_n) \in \ker \varphi$. In that case,
        \[\alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \dots + \alpha_n x_n = 0.\]
        Since $S$ is a basis, we find that $\alpha_i x_i = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Hence, 
        \[(\alpha_1 x_1, \alpha_2 x_2, \dots, \alpha_n x_n) = (0, 0, \dots, 0).\]
        This implies that the kernel is trivial. So, 
        \[G \cong \langle x_1 \rangle \times \langle x_2 \rangle \times \dots \times \langle x_n \rangle.\]
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $G$ be an abelian group, and let $S = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ generate $G$, and let $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ with $\gcd(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n) = 1$. Then, there exists $y_2, y_3, \dots, y_n \in G$ such that $G = \langle y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n \rangle$, where $y_1 = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \dots + c_nx_n$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        We will show this by induction on $s = c_1 + c_2 + \dots + c_n \geq 1$. If $s = 1$, then we know that $c_i = 1$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$, and $c_j = 0$ for all $1 \leq j \leq n$ with $i \neq j$. Hence, $y_1 = x_i$. In that case, we can set $y_2, y_3, \dots, y_n$ to be the remaining elements in $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, and the statement holds. 
        
        Now, assume that $s \geq 2$. Since $\gcd(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n) = 1$, we find that there exist two elements $c_i, c_j \neq 0$. Without loss of generality, assume that $c_1 \geq c_2 > 0$. We claim that $M = \langle x_1, x_1 + x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \rangle$. For $x \in M$, we know that there exist $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ such that
        \[x = \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \dots + \alpha_n x_n.\]
        Hence,
        \[x = (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2) x_1 + \alpha_2 (x_1 + x_2) + \dots + \alpha_n x_n \in \langle x_1, x_1 + x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle.\]
        Hence, $M = \langle x_1, x_1 + x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle$. Moreover, since $\gcd(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n) = 1$, we can find $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ such that
        \[c_1 a_1 + c_2 a_2 + \dots + c_n a_n = 1.\]
        Hence,
        \[(c_1 - c_2) a_1 + c_2 (a_1 + a_2) + \dots + c_n a_n = 1.\]
        This implies that $\gcd(c_1 - c_2, c_2, \dots, c_n) = 1$. Further, we have $(c_1 - c_2) + c_2 + \dots + c_n < s$. So, the induction hypothesis tells us that there exist $y_2, \dots, y_n \in G$ with
        \[y_1 = (c_1 - c_2) x_1 + c_2 (x_1 + x_2) + \dots + c_n x_n = c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + \dots + c_n x_n\]
        such that $M = \langle y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n \rangle$. So, the result follows from induction.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{definition}
        Let $G$ be an abelian group. We say that $G$ is \emph{finitely generated} if there exist $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ such that $G = \langle x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{theorem}
        Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group. Then, $G$ has a basis. In particular, $G$ is a direct product of cyclic groups.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        We will use induction on the length of the shortest generating set. If the length is 1, then $G = \langle x_1 \rangle$, for some $x_1 \in G$. Hence, $\{x_1\}$ is a basis for $G$. Now, assume that the shortest generating set of $G$ has length is $n$. So, fix $G = \langle x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle$, where for any other $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n \in G \setminus \{0\}$ with $G = \langle y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n \rangle$, we have $1 < |x_1| \leq |y_1|$.\sidefootnote{We can get rid of $x_1$ if $|x_1| = 1$, which contradicts the minimality of $n$.} We show that $G \cong \langle x_1 \rangle \times \langle x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle$. So, assume, for a contradiction, that $G \not\cong \langle x_1 \rangle \times \langle x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle$. Define the map $\varphi: \langle x_1 \rangle \times \langle x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle \to G$ by $\varphi(\alpha_1 x_1, w) = \alpha_1 x_1 + w$. This is a surjective homomorphism, so it cannot be injective. So, let $(\alpha_1 x_1, w) \in \ker \varphi$ be a non-trivial element. If $\alpha_1 = 0$, then $\alpha_1 x_1 = 0$ and $w = - \alpha_1 x_1 = 0$ as well, so we must have $\alpha_1 \neq 0$. Denote
        \[w = \alpha_2 x_2 + \dots + \alpha_n x_n.\]
        By changing $x_i$ to $-x_i$ if needed, we can assume that $\alpha_i \geq 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. We can further assume that $\alpha_1 < |x_1|$. We have $d = \gcd(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n) > 0$. So, define $c_i = \alpha_i/d$. Then, the lemma tells us that there exist $y_2, \dots, y_n$ with
        \[y_1 = c_1 x_1 + \dots + c_n x_n\]
        such that $M = \langle y_1, \dots, y_n \rangle$. We know that 
        \[dy_1 = \alpha_1 x_1 + \dots + \alpha_n x_n = 0.\]
        In that case, 
        \[|y_1| \leq d \leq \alpha_1 < |x_1|.\]
        This is a contradiction. Hence, 
        \[G \cong \langle x_1 \rangle \times \langle x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle.\]
        By induction, we know that $\langle x_2, \dots, x_n \rangle$ has a basis $\{z_1, z_2, \dots, z_k\}$. Then, $G$ has basis $\{x_1, z_1, z_2, \dots, z_k\}$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        Let $G$ be a finite abelian group such that for any $k \geq 0$, $G$ has at most $k$ elements of order dividing $k$. Then, $G$ is cyclic.
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
        By the previous result, we find that 
        \[G \cong \langle x_1 \rangle \times \langle x_2 \rangle \times \dots \times \langle x_n \rangle.\]
        Since $G$ is finite, $x_i$ has finite order for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Now, let $1 \leq i, j \leq n$ with $i \neq j$. If $k \mid |x_i|$ and $k \mid |x_j|$, then both $\langle x_i \rangle$ and $\langle x_j \rangle$ have distinct subgroups of order $k$. Hence, $G$ has more than $k$ elements of order dividing $k$. So, we must find that $\gcd(|x_i|, |x_j|) = 1$. In that case,
        \[|(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)| = \lvert x_1 \rvert \lvert x_2 \rvert \dots \lvert x_n \rvert.\]
        Hence, $G$ is cyclic.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        Let $F$ be a field and let $G \leq F^\times$ be finite. Then, $G$ is cyclic.
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$. We know that the equation $x^n - 1 \in F[x]$ has at most $n$ roots. This implies that there are at most $n$ elements of order dividing $n$. Using the result above, it follows that $G$ is cyclic.
    \end{proof}

    \section{The Fundamental Theorem}
    \begin{lemma}
        Let $G$ be an abelian group such that
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_n^{\alpha_ n}},\]
        where $\alpha_i \geq 2$ and $p_i$ prime for $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $r \geq 0$, let $p$ be a prime and let $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$. Then, $p^k$ divides an element in $\{p_1, \dots, p_n\}$ if and only if $G$ has an element of order $p^k$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Assume that $p^k$ divides an element in $\{p_1^{\alpha_1}, \dots, p_n^{\alpha_n}\}$. Without loss of generality, assume further that $p^k \mid p_1$. In that case, consider the element $x = (p_1^{\alpha_1-k}, 0, \dots, 0)$. We find that $x \neq 0$ with 
        \[p^k x = (p_1^{\alpha_1}, 0, \dots, 0) = 0.\]
        Hence, $x \in G$ has order $p^k$.

        Now, assume that $G$ has an element $x$ of order $p^k$. Let $x = (a_1, \dots, a_n)$. We know that $p^{k-1} x \neq 0$, so without loss of generality, assume that $p^{k-1} a_1 \neq 0$. Moreover, since $x$ has order $p^k$, we find that
        \[p^k x = (p^k a_1, \dots, p^k a_n) = 0.\]
        So, $p^k a_1 = 0$. Hence, $|a_1| = p^k$. By Lagrange, we find that $p^k \mid p_1^{\alpha_1}$. 
    \end{proof}

    % \begin{lemma}
    %     Let $G$ be an abelian group such that
    %     \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_n^{\alpha_ n}},\]
    %     where $\alpha_i \geq 2$ and $p_i$ prime for $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $r \geq 0$, and let $p$ be a prime. Then, $p$ occurs $a$ times in the collection $p_1, \dots, p_n$ if and only if $G$ has $p^a$ elements of order dividing $p$.
    % \end{lemma}
    % \begin{proof}
    %     First, assume that $p$ occurs $a$ times in the collection $p_1, \dots, p_n$. Without loss of generality, assume that the first $a$ primes are $p$. Since $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{\alpha_i}}$ are cyclic groups, it follows that they have a (unique) subgroup of order $p$, for $1 \leq i \leq a$. In particular, there are $p$ elements of order dividing $p$. Since every combination of these elements leads to an element of order dividing $p$ (and for any prime $q \neq p$, there is just one element of order dividing $p$- the identity element), it follows that $G$ has precisely $p^a$ elements of order dividing $p$.

    %     Now, assume that $G$ has $p^a$ elements of order $p$. We know that in the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{\alpha_i}}$, if $p_i = p$, then the group has $p$ elements of order dividing $p$, and if $p_i \neq p$, then the group has $1$ element of order dividing $p$. Since there are $p^a$ elements in $G$ of order $p$, we find that $p$ must appear $a$ times in the collection $p_1, \dots, p_n$.
    % \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}
        Let $G$ be an abelian group such that
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_n^{\alpha_ n}},\]
        where $\alpha_i \geq 2$ and $p_i$ prime for $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $r \geq 0$, let $p$ be a prime. Then, for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, $p^k$ divides $a_k$ values in the collection $p_1^{\alpha_1}, \dots, p_n^{\alpha_n}$ if and only if $G$ has 
        \[(p^k)^{a_k} \cdot (p^{k-1})^{a_{k-1} - a_k} \dots (p)^{a_2 - a_1} = p^{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k}\]
        elements of order dividing $p^k$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        First, assume that $p^k$ divides $a_k$ elements in the collection $p_1^{\alpha_1}, \dots, p_n^{\alpha_n}$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$. In a cyclic group, there is at most one subgroup of some order. Since there are $a_k$ elements in the collection $p_1^{\alpha_1}, \dots, p_n^{\alpha_n}$ that $p^k$ divides, it follows that $G$ has $a_k$ subgroups of order $p^k$. In general, $G$ has $a_i$ subgroups of order $p^i$ for $0 \leq i \leq k$. Since a subgroup of order $p^i$ has a single subgroup of order $p^{i-1}$, and it is maximal, it follows that $G$ has 
        \[(p^k)^{a_k} \cdot (p^{k-1})^{a_{k-1} - a_k} \dots (p)^{a_2 - a_1}\]
        elements of order dividing $p^k$.

        % First, assume that $p$ occurs $a$ times in the collection $p_1, \dots, p_n$. Without loss of generality, assume that the first $a$ primes are $p$. Since $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{\alpha_i}}$ are cyclic groups, it follows that they have a (unique) subgroup of order $p$, for $1 \leq i \leq a$. In particular, there are $p$ elements of order dividing $p$. Since every combination of these elements leads to an element of order dividing $p$ (and for any prime $q \neq p$, there is just one element of order dividing $p$- the identity element), it follows that $G$ has precisely $p^a$ elements of order dividing $p$.

        Now, assume that $G$ has 
        \[(p^k)^{a_k} \cdot (p^{k-1})^{a_{k-1} - a_k} \dots (p)^{a_2 - a_1}\]
        elements of order dividing $p^k$. We know that a cyclic group of order dividing $p^k$ has $p^k$ elements of order $p^k$. Moreover, these are counted twice for a cyclic group of order $p^{k-1}$, so we need to remove them. Hence, it follows that $p^k$ divides $a_k$ values in the collection $p_1^{\alpha_1}, \dots, p_n^{\alpha_n}$.

        % Now, assume that $G$ has $p^a$ elements of order $p$. We know that in the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{\alpha_i}}$, if $p_i = p$, then the group has $p$ elements of order dividing $p$, and if $p_i \neq p$, then the group has $1$ element of order dividing $p$. Since there are $p^a$ elements in $G$ of order $p$, we find that $p$ must appear $a$ times in the collection $p_1, \dots, p_n$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups]
        Let $G$ be a non-trivial finitely generated abelian group. Then, 
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}^r \times \mathbb{Z}_{n_1} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{n_k},\]
        where $n_i \geq 2$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $r \geq 0$. Moreover,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $r$ (called the \emph{rank}) is uniquely determined by $G$;
            \item the values $n_i$ can be chosen such that $n_1 \mid n_2 \mid \dots \mid n_k$- these are uniquely determined by $G$ (called the \emph{invariant factors});
            \item the values $n_i$ can be chosen to be prime powers- these are uniquely determined by $G$, up to permutation (called the \emph{elementary divisors}).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        We have shown that
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}^r \times \mathbb{Z}_{n_1} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{n_k}\]
        since these are precisely the cyclic groups. We first show that the rank is uniquely determined by $G$. So, let $p$ be a prime such that $p \nmid n_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq k$. Then, 
        \[G/pG \cong (\mathbb{Z}_p)^r\]
        since $\mathbb{Z}_{n_i} = p\mathbb{Z}_{n_i}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq k$- we have $(p, n_i) = 1$. The space $(\mathbb{Z}_p)^r$ is a vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$. We have
        \[r = \dim_{\mathbb{F}_p} (G/pG)^r,\]
        so it is uniquely determined by $G$.
        
        We will now show the existence of elementary divisors. We know that for $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, if $(n_1, n_2) = 1$, then
        \[\mathbb{Z}_{n_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{n_2} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{n_1 n_2}.\]
        So, if the prime factorisation of $n_i$ is $n_i = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \dots p_k^{\alpha_k}$, then
        \[\mathbb{Z}_{n_i} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_2^{\alpha_2}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_k^{\alpha_k}}.\]
        Hence, we have the existence of elementary divisors. Using this, we can construct invariant factors- assume that the following is the elementary divisor representation of $G$:
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_{1, 1}}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_{1, n}}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_2^{\alpha_{2, 1}}} \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_k^{\alpha_{k, n}}},\]
        where $p_i^{\alpha_{i, n}} \geq 1$ and $0 \leq \alpha_{i, j-1} \leq \alpha_{i, j}$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $1 \leq j \leq n$. Then,
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{x_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{x_2} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{x_n}\]
        is the invariant factor representation for $G$, where
        \[x_j = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_{i, j}}.\]
        By construction, we have $x_1 \mid x_2 \mid \dots \mid x_n$. Hence, we can find an invariant factor representation for $G$.

        We next show the uniqueness of elementary divisors and invariant factors. Since there is an algorithm that produces invariant factors from elementary divisors, it suffices to show that the elementary divisors are unique. Assume that 
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_2^{\alpha_2}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_k^{\alpha_k}}.\]
        We saw above that for for any $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, $p^k$ divides $a_k$ values in the collection $p_1^{\alpha_1}, \dots, p_n^{\alpha_n}$ if and only if $G$ has a fixed number of elements of order dividing $p^k$. This is characterised by each group, and so implies that the elementary divisors are unique.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{example}
        Let
        \[G = \mathbb{Z}_{16} \times \mathbb{Z}_{18} \times \mathbb{Z}_{27} \times \mathbb{Z}_{52}.\]
        This is a finitely generated abelian group, but is not in elementary divisor form or invariant factor form. To convert it to elementary divisor, we break each factor into its prime factors.
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_{16} \times \mathbb{Z}_9 \times \mathbb{Z}_{27} \times \mathbb{Z}_{13}.\]
        Now, to convert it to invariant factors, we write all the factors as follows:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                2 & 4 & 16 \\
                1 & 9 & 27 \\
                1 & 1 & 13 
            \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        \noindent We combine each column to construct the invariant factors. In this case, we have
        \[G \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_{36} \times \mathbb{Z}_{5616}.\]
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
        Consider the following presentation for a finitely generated abelian group:
        \[G = \langle x_1, x_2, x_3 \mid x_1 - 2x_2 = 0, x_1 + 10x_2 + 22x_3 =0 \rangle.\]
        We will represent this in terms of cyclic groups. We can represent this information in a matrix of generators and relations:
        \[\begin{bmatrix}
            1 & -2 & 0 \\
            1 & 10 & 22
        \end{bmatrix}.\]
        We can convert it into Smith Normal Form using the following elementary operations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item multiply a row/column by an integer multiple of other row/column;
            \item multiply a row/column by $-1$;
            \item interchange row/columns.
        \end{itemize}
        The aim is to keep the upper diagonal entries in the matrix, by keeping positive and minimal (so that multiplying makes it 0).
        \begin{align*}
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & -2 & 0 \\
                1 & 10 & 22
            \end{bmatrix} &\xrightarrow{R_2 \to R_2 - R_1} \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & -2 & 0 \\
                0 & 12 & 18
            \end{bmatrix} \\
            &\xrightarrow{C_2 \to C_2 + 2C_1} \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & 12 & 18
            \end{bmatrix} \\
            &\xrightarrow{C_3 \to C_3 - C_2} \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & 12 & 6
            \end{bmatrix} \\
            &\xrightarrow{C_3 \leftrightarrow C_2} \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & 6 & 12
            \end{bmatrix} \\
            &\xrightarrow{C_3 \to C_2 - 2C_3} \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & 6 & 0
            \end{bmatrix} 
        \end{align*}
        So, the group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_1 \times \mathbb{Z}_6 \times \mathbb{Z}$- we have a copy of $\mathbb{Z}$ since we need to add one row to make a square matrix.
    \end{example}
